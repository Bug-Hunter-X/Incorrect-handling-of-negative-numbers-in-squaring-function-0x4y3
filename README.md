# Julia Bug: Incorrect Squaring of Negative Numbers

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia when dealing with negative numbers and squaring.

The `bug.jl` file contains a function that is intended to square its input, regardless of its sign.  However, it produces incorrect output for negative inputs.

The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version of the function.
